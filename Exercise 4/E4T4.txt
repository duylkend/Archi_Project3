# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move the web application instance to the private subnet.
# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
YES. we can create AWS VPC S3 Enpoint to access S3 from VPC. improve the security and performance since the read s3 bucket are not leave AWS network.
# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
NO. default encryption does not change the encryption of existing objects in the same bucket. but you could to it with AWS CLI but not directly.
# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It will not affect in case we create new resource with Cloud-Formation. if we do want to make it work then we had to update the Cloud-Formation .yml file
