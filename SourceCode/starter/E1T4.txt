Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web Service Instance should not place in the public subnet to facing with internet because we have load balancer already do that.
instead of we should place "Web Service Instance" in the private subnet and config only allow connect from load balancer ( config security-group only allow from load balancer security-group)

# Poor practice 2
S3 should have policy which only allow access from the Web Service Instance and the connection should not leave AWS network.
